### Installation Guide
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies by running `composer install`. If you don't have composer installed, you can download it [here](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
   Although, there aren't any dependencies required to run the application, some like `symfony/var-dumper` were used during debugging and development.
3. Run the application by running `php -S localhost:8000 -t public` in the root directory of the project.
